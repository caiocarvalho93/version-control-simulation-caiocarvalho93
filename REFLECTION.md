Version Control Simulation

In this project I practiced setting up and working with Git in a structured, professional workflow. I started by creating a new repository on GitHub.. cloned it then moved on to creating different features such as 'feature/header' and 'feature/footer', which then the assignmente purposely had me create a conflict. I was a bit confused and honestly should not have submitted my first try while in my group because now I am realizing I did it correctly (but not following steps) in this assigment... & mightve as well turnd into the wrong assingment on Canas (first days I was still figuring it all out). 

So, today I followed it correctly, caused the conflict and managed to choose the option I wanted for final product. This Assignment gave me an opportunity to practice real world professional "working in teams" environment, which is great for someone like myself who is used to working individually until the staert of this year. Great practice and explanation of working in different branches then submitting it all to your one "MASTER/MAIN", now submitting! 

Finally, I decided to add reflection (not sure if it was due, but more practice as I commit again, and submit final repo to Canvas).
